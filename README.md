## SANBERCODE CRUD ONE

This project is a part of sanbercode bootcamp project.
What I have learned from this project are :

0. Bootstrap tweaking
1. Eloquent vs Query Builder
2. Basic Relational Database
3. Templating blade
    - [yield section (partial doc)]
    - [stack push (for script doc)]
    - [include (keeping main template clean)]
4. How to handle objects dinamically back and forth between controller and view
5. Using static built in function in Eloquent for e.g. save(), get(), etc.
6. Basic CRUD
